Title: The New Inweb Syntax Exhausted
Author: Graham Nelson
Purpose: Some of everything you can write in this syntax.
Language: C

@ A regular paragraph begins here,
and continues here.

@ ^"Cosmopolitan" ^"Banal"
This paragraph has two tags.

>> Also a quotation, which is curiously structured like this,
>> continuing thus.

@h Subheading here. This is now text placed
under that subheading.

@ Some definitions:

@d ALPHA 1
@d BETA_GAMMA 201 /* one more than 200 */
@d DELTA 200
	+ 300
	+ more_delta
@define EPSILON ALPHA
@default LAMBDA 10

@d MU printf("mu");

@e X_FAM from 1
@e Y_FAM
@e Z_FAM
@enum X_ALT from 100
@e Y_ALT

@ Some code:

@d RANGE 100

=
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	for (int i=1; i<RANGE; i++)
		@<Test for twin prime at i@>;
}

@<Test for twin prime at i@> =
	if ((isprime(i)) && (isprime(i+2)))
		printf("%d and %d\n", i, i+2);

@ Let's have some extracts now.

= (text)
This is not code, but an
extract spanning two lines.
=

= (hyperlinked text)
This is //hyperlinked//, but still an
extract spanning two lines.
=

= (undisplayed text)
This is undisplayed, but still an
extract spanning two lines.
=

= (hyperlinked undisplayed text)
This is //hyperlinked// and undisplayed, but still an
extract spanning two lines.
=

= (text to something)
This is not code, but an
extract spanning two lines.
=

= (text as code)
int example_not_in_program(void) {
	return 0;
}
=

= (text as Perl)
# Here's some Perl.
my $var = "22";
=

= (text from associated/elsewhere.txt)

= (text from associated/elsewhere.txt as code)

= (text from associated/elsewhere.txt as Perl)

@ And now some insertions.

= (html somefile.html)
= (figure somefile.jpg)
= (audio somefile.mp3)
= (video somefile.m4v)
= (download whatever/else.mp3)
= (download whatever/else.mp3 "Some text")

= (carousel "Phase I")
This is some text about Phase I.
= (carousel "Phase II" above)
This one has the caption above.
= (carousel "Phase III" below)
This one has the caption below.
= (carousel)
No caption at all this time.
= (carousel end)
