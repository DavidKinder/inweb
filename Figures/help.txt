  -weave-as X            set weave pattern to X (default is 'HTML')
  -weave-into X          weave, but into directory X
  -weave-tag X           weave, but only using material tagged as X
  -weave-to X            weave, but to filename X (for single files only)

for tangling a web:
  -ctags-to X            tangle, but write Universal Ctags file to X not to 'tags'
  -no-ctags              don't write a Universal Ctags file when tangling (default is -ctags)
  -tangle                tangle the web into machine-compilable form
